DOCUMENTATION:
-------------

https://typegraphql.com/docs/types-and-fields.html
The main idea of TypeGraphQL is to automatically create GraphQL schema definitions from TypeScript classes. To avoid the need for schema definition files and interfaces describing the schema, we use decorators and a bit of reflection magic.

SUMMARY: With TypeGraphQl @ObjectType and @Field decorators, we are allowing the graphql schema to collect metadata and incorporate that metadata with the typescript reflection system.


@ObjectType decorator marks the class as the type known from the GraphQL SDL or GraphQLObjectType from graphql-js:

@Field decorator mark which class properties should be mapped to the GraphQL fields and collect metadata from the TypeScript reflection system.
